<h3>Course Description</h3>
<p>Computer programming is virtually indispensible in modern geoscience. This course provides an introduction to scientific computer programming using the Python language. After completing this course, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Write a computer program in Python to solve a common scientific problem such as reading in and plotting data, analyzing a dataset by performing calculations on its values, or performing calculations using a mathematical model.</li>
    <li>Explain the basic elements of the Python programming language, such as variables, data types, operations, and functions.</li>
    <li>Use common scientific packages such as NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib.</li>
    <li>Understand and modify scientific Python scripts written by others.</li>
    <li>Draw on a portfolio of well-documented programming examples created during the semester for examples and reminders of how to write Python code for various types of application.</li>
</ul>

<p>The material will be motivated using various geoscientific problems that involve programming.</p>

<h3>Required Work and Grading</h3>
<p>The primary work in the course involves a series of "code paper" assignments, all or most of which will be done using Jupyter Notebooks. A Jupyter Notebook is an interactive document that you create and edit through a web browser. Notebooks can combine text, pictures, nicely formatted math, Python code, and plots. This combination makes them really useful for the work in this course. The first sessions will introduce you to Jupyter Notebooks.</p>
<p>Assignments will usually be handed out on Thursdays and will be due on Thursday of the following week. It is crucial that assignments be handed in on time, so that you don't fall behind. The lowest paper score will be dropped. Papers should be turned in electronically, in the form of the notebook file, and are due by midnight on the given due date.</p>
<p>Final grades are based on code papers (55%), daily in-class notebook exercises (30%), and a final project (15%).</p>
<h3>What if you get sick or need to quarantine?</h3>
<p>If you get sick or need to quarantine, please let me know so I can help you connect with any missed material. You do not have to tell me anything about the nature of the situation, and you do not need a doctor's note.</p>

<h3>Other Matters</h3>
<h4>Requirements for COVID-19</h4>
<p>As a matter of public health and safety, all members of the CU Boulder community and all visitors to campus must follow university, department and building requirements and all public health orders in place to reduce the risk of spreading infectious disease. CU Boulder currently requires COVID-19 vaccination and boosters for all faculty, staff and students. Students, faculty and staff must upload proof of vaccination and boosters or file for an exemption based on medical, ethical or moral grounds through the MyCUHealth portal.</p>
<p>The CU Boulder campus is currently mask-optional. However, if public health conditions change and masks are again required in classrooms, students who fail to adhere to masking requirements will be asked to leave class, and students who do not leave class when asked or who refuse to comply with these requirements will be referred to Student Conduct and Conflict Resolution. For more information, see the policy on classroom behavior and the Student Code of Conduct. If you require accommodation because a disability prevents you from fulfilling these safety measures, please follow the steps in the &ldquo;Accommodation for Disabilities&rdquo; statement on this syllabus.</p>
<p>If you feel ill and think you might have COVID-19, if you have tested positive for COVID-19, or if you are unvaccinated or partially vaccinated and have been in close contact with someone who has COVID-19, you should stay home and follow the further guidance of the Public Health Office (<a href="mailto:contacttracing@colorado.edu">contacttracing@colorado.edu</a>). If you are fully vaccinated and have been in close contact with someone who has COVID-19, you do not need to stay home; rather, you should self-monitor for symptoms and follow the further guidance of the Public Health Office (<a href="mailto:contacttracing@colorado.edu">contacttracing@colorado.edu</a>).</p>
<p>In this class, if you need to stay home due to illness, exposure, and/or a positive COVID-19 test, please email me if you would like me to open a zoom channel for the lecture (note that I can't guarantee that the quality of sound or video will be ideal).</p>
<h4>Classroom Behavior</h4>
<p>Both students and faculty are responsible for maintaining an appropriate learning environment in all instructional settings, whether in person, remote or online. Those who fail to adhere to such behavioral standards may be subject to discipline. Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals and topics dealing with race, color, national origin, sex, pregnancy, age, disability, creed, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, veteran&nbsp;status, political affiliation or political philosophy.&nbsp; For more information, see the policies on <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/policies/student-classroom-and-course-related-behavior">classroom behavior</a> and the <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/sccr/student-conduct">Student Conduct &amp; Conflict Resolution policies</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Accommodation for Disabilities</h4>
<p>If you qualify for accommodations because of a disability, please submit your accommodation letter from Disability Services to your faculty member in a timely manner so that your needs can be addressed.&nbsp; Disability Services determines accommodations based on documented disabilities in the academic environment.&nbsp; Information on requesting accommodations is located on the <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/disabilityservices/">Disability Services website</a>. Contact Disability Services at 303-492-8671 or <a href="mailto:dsinfo@colorado.edu">dsinfo@colorado.edu</a> for further assistance.&nbsp; If you have a temporary medical condition, see <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/disabilityservices/students/temporary-medical-conditions">Temporary Medical Conditions</a> on the Disability Services website.</p>
<h4>Preferred Student Names and Pronouns</h4>
<p>CU Boulder recognizes that students' legal information doesn't always align with how they identify. Students may update their preferred names and pronouns via the student portal; those preferred names and pronouns are listed on instructors' class rosters. In the absence of such updates, the name that appears on the class roster is the student's legal name.</p>
<h4>Honor Code</h4>

<h4>Sexual Misconduct, Discrimination, Harassment and/or Related Retaliation</h4>
<p>CU Boulder is committed to fostering an inclusive and welcoming learning, working, and living environment. University policy prohibits sexual misconduct (harassment, exploitation, and assault), intimate partner violence (dating or domestic violence), stalking, protected-class discrimination and harassment, and related retaliation by or against members of our community on- and off-campus. These behaviors harm individuals and our community.

<h4>Religious Holidays</h4>
<p>Campus policy regarding religious observances requires that faculty make every effort to deal reasonably and fairly with all students who, because of religious obligations, have conflicts with scheduled exams, assignments or required attendance. In this class, you should notify the TA and me if you must miss a lab due to religious observance, and review any notes or other materials that are posted on Canvas. If you miss a lecture, please ask another student for notes.
