<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Computer programming is virtually indispensable in modern geoscience. This course provides an introduction to scientific computer programming using the Python language. After completing this course, you will be able to:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
    <li class="li5"><span class="s1">Write a computer program in Python to solve a common scientific problem such as reading in and plotting data, analyzing a dataset by performing calculations on its values, or performing calculations using a mathematical model.</span></li>
    <li class="li5"><span class="s1">Explain the basic elements of the Python programming language, such as variables, data types, operations, and functions.</span></li>
    <li class="li5"><span class="s1">Use common scientific packages such as NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib.</span></li>
    <li class="li5"><span class="s1">Understand and modify scientific Python scripts written by others.</span></li>
    <li class="li5"><span class="s1">Draw on a portfolio of well-documented programming examples created during the semester for examples and reminders of how to write Python code for various types of application.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The material will be motivated using various geoscientific problems that involve programming.</span></p>
<h3 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 14.0px 0.0px; font: 14.0px Times; color: #000000;"><span class="s1"><strong>Required Work and Grading</strong></span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The primary work in the course involves a series of "code paper" assignments, all or most of which will be done using Jupyter Notebooks. A Jupyter Notebook is an interactive document that you create and edit through a web browser. Notebooks can combine text, pictures, nicely formatted math, Python code, and plots. This combination makes them really useful for the work in this course. The first sessions will introduce you to Jupyter Notebooks.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Assignments will usually be handed out on Wednesdays and will be due on Wednessday of the following week. It is crucial that assignments be handed in on time, so that you don't fall behind. The lowest paper score will be dropped. Papers should be turned in electronically, in the form of the notebook file, and are due by midnight on the given due date.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Final grades are based on code papers (50%), daily in-class notebook exercises (20%), slide and brief presentation on a Python package (5%), and a final project (25%).</span></p>
<h3 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 14.0px 0.0px; font: 14.0px Times; color: #000000;"><span class="s1"><strong>What if you get sick or need to quarantine?</strong></span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If you get sick or need to quarantine, please let me know so I can help you connect with any missed material. You do not have to tell me anything about the nature of the situation, and you do not need a doctor's note.</span></p>

<h4 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 16.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Times; color: #000000;"><span class="s1"><strong>Requirements for COVID-19</strong></span></h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As a matter of public health and safety, all members of the CU Boulder community and all visitors to campus must follow university, department and building requirements and all public health orders in place to reduce the risk of spreading infectious disease. CU Boulder currently requires COVID-19 vaccination and boosters for all faculty, staff and students. Students, faculty and staff must upload proof of vaccination and boosters or file for an exemption based on medical, ethical or moral grounds through the MyCUHealth portal.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The CU Boulder campus is currently mask-optional. However, if public health conditions change and masks are again required in classrooms, students who fail to adhere to masking requirements will be asked to leave class, and students who do not leave class when asked or who refuse to comply with these requirements will be referred to Student Conduct and Conflict Resolution. For more information, see the policy on classroom behavior and the Student Code of Conduct. If you require accommodation because a disability prevents you from fulfilling these safety measures, please follow the steps in the &ldquo;Accommodation for Disabilities&rdquo; statement on this syllabus.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If you feel ill and think you might have COVID-19, if you have tested positive for COVID-19, or if you are unvaccinated or partially vaccinated and have been in close contact with someone who has COVID-19, you should stay home and follow the further guidance of the Public Health Office (<a href="mailto:contacttracing@colorado.edu"><span class="s5">contacttracing@colorado.edu</span></a>). If you are fully vaccinated and have been in close contact with someone who has COVID-19, you do not need to stay home; rather, you should self-monitor for symptoms and follow the further guidance of the Public Health Office (<a href="mailto:contacttracing@colorado.edu"><span class="s5">contacttracing@colorado.edu</span></a>).</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In this class, if you need to stay home due to illness, exposure, and/or a positive COVID-19 test, please email me if you would like me to open a zoom channel for the lecture (note that I can't guarantee that the quality of sound or video will be ideal).</span></p>
<h4 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 16.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Times; color: #000000;"><span class="s1"><strong>Classroom Behavior</strong></span></h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Both students and faculty are responsible for maintaining an appropriate learning environment in all instructional settings, whether in person, remote or online. Those who fail to adhere to such behavioral standards may be subject to discipline. Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals and topics dealing with race, color, national origin, sex, pregnancy, age, disability, creed, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, veteran&nbsp;status, political affiliation or political philosophy.&nbsp; For more information, see the policies on <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/policies/student-classroom-and-course-related-behavior"><span class="s5">classroom behavior</span></a> and the <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/sccr/student-conduct"><span class="s5">Student Conduct &amp; Conflict Resolution policies</span></a>.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If you qualify for accommodations because of a disability, please submit your accommodation letter from Disability Services to your faculty member in a timely manner so that your needs can be addressed.&nbsp; Disability Services determines accommodations based on documented disabilities in the academic environment.&nbsp; Information on requesting accommodations is located on the <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/disabilityservices/"><span class="s5">Disability Services website</span></a>. Contact Disability Services at 303-492-8671 or <a href="mailto:dsinfo@colorado.edu"><span class="s5">dsinfo@colorado.edu</span></a> for further assistance.&nbsp; If you have a temporary medical condition, see <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/disabilityservices/students/temporary-medical-conditions"><span class="s5">Temporary Medical Conditions</span></a> on the Disability Services website.</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">CU Boulder recognizes that students' legal information doesn't always align with how they identify. Students may update their preferred names and pronouns via the student portal; those preferred names and pronouns are listed on instructors' class rosters. In the absence of such updates, the name that appears on the class roster is the student's legal name.</span></p>
<h4 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 16.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Times; color: #000000;"><span class="s1"><strong>Honor Code</strong></span></h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">All students enrolled in a University of Colorado Boulder course are responsible for knowing and adhering to&nbsp;the Honor Code academic integrity policy.&nbsp;Violations of the Honor Code may include, but are not limited to: plagiarism, cheating, fabrication, lying, bribery, threat, unauthorized access to academic materials, clicker fraud, submitting the same or similar work in more than one course without permission from all course instructors involved, and aiding academic dishonesty. All incidents of academic misconduct will be reported to the Honor Code ( <a href="mailto:honor@colorado.edu"><span class="s6">honor@colorado.edu</span> </a></span><span class="s7">);&nbsp;303-492-5550). Students found responsible for violating the academic integrity policy will be subject to nonacademic sanctions from the Honor Code as well as academic sanctions from the faculty member. Additional information regarding the Honor Code academic integrity policy can be found on the&nbsp;</span><span class="s1"> <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/osccr/honor-code"><span class="s8">Honor Code website</span> </a>.</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">CU Boulder is committed to fostering an inclusive and welcoming learning, working, and living environment. University policy prohibits sexual misconduct (harassment, exploitation, and assault), intimate partner violence (dating or domestic violence), stalking, protected-class discrimination and harassment, and related retaliation by or against members of our community on- and off-campus. These behaviors harm individuals and our community. The Office of Institutional Equity and Compliance (OIEC) addresses these policies, and individuals who believe they have been subjected to misconduct can contact OIEC at 303-492-2127 or email <a href="mailto:cureport@colorado.edu"><span class="s5">cureport@colorado.edu</span></a>. Information about university policies, <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/oiec/reporting-resolutions/making-report"><span class="s5">reporting options</span></a>, and support resources can be found on the <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/institutionalequity/"><span class="s5">OIEC website</span></a>.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Please know that faculty and graduate instructors have a responsibility to inform OIEC when they are made aware of any issues related to these policies regardless of when or where they occurred to ensure that individuals impacted receive information about their rights, support resources, and resolution options.

<h4 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 16.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Times; color: #000000;"><span class="s1"><strong>Religious Holidays</strong></span></h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Campus policy regarding religious observances requires that faculty make every effort to deal reasonably and fairly with all students who, because of religious obligations, have conflicts with scheduled exams, assignments or required attendance. In this class, you should notify the TA and me if you must miss a lab due to religious observance, and review any notes or other materials that are posted on Canvas. If you miss a lecture, please ask another student for notes. See the <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/policies/observance-religious-holidays-and-absences-classes-andor-exams"><span class="s5">campus policy regarding religious observances</span></a> for full details.</span></p>
