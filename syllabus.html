<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Computer programming is virtually indispensable in modern geoscience. This course provides an introduction to scientific computer programming using the Python language. After completing this course, you will be able to:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
    <li class="li5"><span class="s1">Write a computer program in Python to solve a common scientific problem such as reading in and plotting data, analyzing a dataset by performing calculations on its values, or performing calculations using a mathematical model.</span></li>
    <li class="li5"><span class="s1">Explain the basic elements of the Python programming language, such as variables, data types, operations, and functions.</span></li>
    <li class="li5"><span class="s1">Use common scientific packages such as NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib.</span></li>
    <li class="li5"><span class="s1">Understand and modify scientific Python scripts written by others.</span></li>
    <li class="li5"><span class="s1">Draw on a portfolio of well-documented programming examples created during the semester for examples and reminders of how to write Python code for various types of application.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The material will be motivated using various geoscientific problems that involve programming.</span></p>
<h3 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 14.0px 0.0px; font: 14.0px Times; color: #000000;"><span class="s1"><strong>Required Work and Grading</strong></span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The primary work in the course involves a series of "code paper" assignments, all or most of which will be done using Jupyter Notebooks. A Jupyter Notebook is an interactive document that you create and edit through a web browser. Notebooks can combine text, pictures, nicely formatted math, Python code, and plots. This combination makes them really useful for the work in this course. The first sessions will introduce you to Jupyter Notebooks.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Assignments will usually be handed out on Wednesdays and will be due on Wednessday of the following week. It is crucial that assignments be handed in on time, so that you don't fall behind. The lowest paper score will be dropped. Papers should be turned in electronically, in the form of the notebook file, and are due by midnight on the given due date.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Final grades are based on code papers (50%), daily in-class notebook exercises (20%), slide and brief presentation on a Python package (5%), and a final project (25%).</span></p>
<h3 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 14.0px 0.0px; font: 14.0px Times; color: #000000;"><span class="s1"><strong>What if you get sick or need to quarantine?</strong></span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If you get sick or need to quarantine, please let me know so I can help you connect with any missed material. You do not have to tell me anything about the nature of the situation, and you do not need a doctor's note.</span></p>

<p>Members of the CU Boulder community and visitors to campus must follow university, department, and building health and safety requirements and all public health orders to reduce the risk of spreading infectious diseases.</p>
<p>The CU Boulder campus is currently mask optional. However, if masks are again required in classrooms, students who fail to adhere to masking requirements will be asked to leave class. Students who do not leave class when asked or who refuse to comply with these requirements will be referred to Student Conduct &amp; Conflict Resolution. Students who require accommodation because a disability prevents them from fulfilling safety measures related to infectious disease will be asked to follow the steps in the &ldquo;Accommodation for Disabilities&rdquo; statement on this syllabus.</p>
<p>For those who feel ill and think you might have COVID-19 or if you have tested positive for COVID-19, please stay home and follow the <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/healthcenter/coronavirus-updates/symptoms-and-what-do-if-you-feel-sick">further guidance of the Public Health Office</a>. For those who have been in close contact with someone who has COVID-19 but do not have any symptoms and have not tested positive for COVID-19, you do not need to stay home.</p>

<p>Students and faculty are responsible for maintaining an appropriate learning environment in all instructional settings, whether in person, remote, or online.

<p>CU Boulder recognizes that students' legal information doesn't always align with how they identify.
